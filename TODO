Image expansion UX
	like the tumblr theme used on lightboner, grid of images below single expanded image.
	clicking any in grid makes it the big one
	add controls and key nav for cycling through set of images.
	show metadata off to the right of image
	fancy animations prolly
	
get user names from RT (or check api response) and link them, as well as other metadata
